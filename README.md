Observations
canvas appears to layer from first declared on bottom and later declared on top.
drawing images onto canvas needs delay so images load before drawing. won't work if it tries to run before the image loads. PRELOAD using link keyword






for movment initial
2nd canvas over top of the first. player sprite on that. map canvas stays untouched currently
